# Revo-FlashCard
Revo-FlashCard is a cool app that helps you learn all sorts of stuff. Whether you want to pick up new words in a foreign language or nail down those chemistry elements, it's got you covered!
You can install it on your windows computer using .msi file in this directory.
```
Setup-Revo/Debug/Setup-Revo.msi
```
You may get a security allert since I haven't purchased a code signing certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority. But you can click on more info and then run anyway.<br>
